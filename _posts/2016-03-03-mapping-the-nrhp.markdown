Seeing a plaque for the [National Register of Historic Places][1] at a building in downtown Hartford got me wondering about other historic buildings around, so I put together a quick map with [CartoDB][2] using data put out by the National Park Service.

As it turns out, there are sites all over.

The data only include non-sensitive locations, but if you're considering visiting any of these places, please keep in mind that many are privately owned and don't allow or want visits.  Do some research (the popup bubbles include search links) first.
