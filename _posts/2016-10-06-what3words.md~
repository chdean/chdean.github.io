[A lot](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/the-most-interesting-story-about-postal-addresses-you-have-ever-read/487160/) has already been written about What3Words, a company developing a new global addressing system that divides the world into a 3x3 meter grid with each square represented by three words. Without rehashing *all* the issues it brings up, I have to wonder, what is the possible justification for privitizng something as fundamental and generic as geographic coordinates? What3Words does have some (arguable) advantages over lat/long coordinates, but there's nothing about its implementation that couldn't be done as an open project. [XAddress](http://xaddress.org/), for example, does essentially the same thing for free.

Addressing systems like What3Words are a means of communication, of representing a location in a shareable way. Means of communication work better the more people have access to them. There's a reason email has stuck around for 30 years despite numerous attempts to replace it. Open standards work.
