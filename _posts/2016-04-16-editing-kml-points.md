I made this screencast for a client who wanted a way to easily edit points in a web map I made for him.  It drew it's data from a KML file, an XML format for geographic data used especially by the [Google Maps API][1] and [Google Earth][2].  Google Earth makes it pretty easy to edit a KML layer that can then be used in other mapping platforms.

For the curious, the dataset used in the video is derived from the *[BBQ Restaurants Mom And Pop Locations][3]* set on [POI Factory][4].
